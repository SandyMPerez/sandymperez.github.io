                    <p class="lead mb-4">I’m an automotive and sales operations professional who turns dealer, market, and service data into clear decisions and day-to-day execution. 
                        My background spans field operations and dealer consulting - managing allocation and scheduling across large networks, shaping inventory and parts strategies, 
                        and partnering with store leaders to streamline workflows and improve customer experience. I build practical tools and routines around forecasting, pricing/mix analysis, 
                        KPI frameworks, and test-and-learn coaching so teams can move from insight to action.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">My education complements that work: a B.S. in Supply Chain & Operations Management, ongoing graduate study (M.S. in Management & Leadership expected 2026), 
                        and professional certificates in data analytics, business analytics, business leadership, solutions design thinking, and operations excellence. I’ve also completed leadership 
                        coursework emphasizing values-based leadership, project management, and change management. Together, these programs reinforce how I approach my work - grounded in real operations, 
                        aligned to business outcomes, and supported by clear communication and adoption. </p>

    I grew up on a barrier island and have always been drawn to water, animals,
    and travel. I enjoy bike rides around
    town, kayaking, exploring new parks, going to community events, or taking our dogs for a ride 
    in the car along the river with all of the windows down. I’m always on the lookout for great
    restaurants with good food, kind service, and a beautiful view.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the years I’ve worked with people from all walks of life in
    roles as varied as clinic supervisor, licensed massage therapist, and 
    funeral director and embalmer. I've owned two businesses, and feel all of these 
    experiences gave me a deep respect for regulated, detail-driven work and for caring for people during 
    some of their most important moments.
  </p>

    Math has always been my favorite subject, and I’ve been analytical for as
    long as I can remember - I was the kid who took electronic toys apart just to see how
    they worked and then put them back together. I still own my favorite
    childhood toy: a Little Professor calculator. That same curiosity now shows
    up in my love of data, operations, and process improvement. I’m a lifelong
    learner (friends & family jokingly call me a “professional student”) and I’m
    constantly taking courses, earning new credentials, and sharpening the
    skills that help me understand problems, design better systems, and support
    the people around me.
