                    <p class="lead mb-4">I’m an automotive and sales operations professional who turns dealer, market, and service data into clear decisions and day-to-day execution. My background spans field operations and dealer consulting - managing allocation and scheduling across large networks, shaping inventory and parts strategies, and partnering with store leaders to streamline workflows and improve customer experience. I build practical tools and routines around forecasting, pricing/mix analysis, KPI frameworks, and test-and-learn coaching so teams can move from insight to action.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">My education complements that work: a B.S. in Supply Chain & Operations Management, ongoing graduate study (M.S. in Management & Leadership expected 2026), and professional certificates in data analytics, business analytics, business leadership, solutions design thinking, and operations excellence. I’ve also completed leadership coursework emphasizing values-based leadership, project management, and change management. Together, these programs reinforce how I approach my work—grounded in real operations, aligned to business outcomes, and supported by clear communication and adoption. </p>

                    <p>I’m happiest when I'm with my family and dogs. When I’m not working, I'm either attending local community events, outside taking care of my plants and landscaping, huddled up indoors binge-watching a tv series or movie (with the blinds drawn, a heavy blanket, and some good snacks), or playing with my dogs.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">I love doing anything with my husband or my kids, bike rides around town or the park, kayaking, taking my dogs anywhere for an R-I-D-E, and finding good restaurants with good food, great service, and a beautiful view. I’m also a lifelong learner - friends joke I’m a “professional student” since I am always taking courses, chasing new skills, and staying curious.</p>
