                    <p class="lead mb-4">I’m an automotive and sales operations professional who turns dealer, market, and service data into clear decisions and day-to-day execution. 
                        My background spans field operations and dealer consulting - managing allocation and scheduling across large networks, shaping inventory and parts strategies, 
                        and partnering with store leaders to streamline workflows and improve customer experience. I build practical tools and routines around forecasting, pricing/mix analysis, 
                        KPI frameworks, and test-and-learn coaching so teams can move from insight to action.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">My education complements that work: a B.S. in Supply Chain & Operations Management, ongoing graduate study (M.S. in Management & Leadership expected 2026), 
                        and professional certificates in data analytics, business analytics, business leadership, solutions design thinking, and operations excellence. I’ve also completed leadership 
                        coursework emphasizing values-based leadership, project management, and change management. Together, these programs reinforce how I approach my work - grounded in real operations, 
                        aligned to business outcomes, and supported by clear communication and adoption. </p>

          </summary>

          <p class="role-summary mt-2">
            Before moving into automotive, sales operations, and analytics, I led teams and day-to-day
            operations in funeral services, medical spas, and dental practices. These roles strengthened
            my experience in people leadership, high-stakes client service, and running compliant,
            process-driven businesses.
          </p>

          <ul class="role-bullets mb-2">
            <li>Managed end-to-end operations for funeral homes and medical spas, including scheduling, inventory, vendor management, and basic financial tracking.</li>
            <li>Led and coached multidisciplinary teams (licensed clinicians, service staff, and office staff) on service standards, workflows, and client communication.</li>
            <li>Worked directly with diverse clients and families in highly sensitive situations, translating complex options into clear, empathetic recommendations.</li>
            <li>Maintained rigorous documentation and regulatory compliance across licensed environments (licensing, safety/OSHA practices, records, and audits).</li>
            <li>Owned small-business operations as an independent provider, using appointment and revenue patterns to plan staffing, promotions, and service mix.</li>

                    <p class="mb-0">I’m happiest when I'm with my family and dogs. When I’m not working, I'm either attending local community events, outside taking care of my plants and landscaping, 
                        huddled up indoors binge-watching a tv series or movie (with the blinds drawn, a heavy blanket, and some good snacks), or playing with my dogs.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">I love doing anything with my husband or my kids, bike rides around town or the park, kayaking, taking my dogs anywhere for an R-I-D-E, and finding good restaurants 
                        with good food, great service, and a beautiful view. I’m also a lifelong learner - friends joke I’m a “professional student” since I am always taking courses, chasing new skills, 
                        and staying curious.</p>
